    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Chef John's Salmon is a delightful dish that showcases the natural flavors
      of fresh salmon complemented by a flavorful herb spread. To prepare this
      dish, two 8-ounce center-cut salmon fillets, complete with skin, are
      seasoned with a touch of kosher salt. The fillets are then placed skin
      side down on a foil-lined baking sheet that has been lightly brushed with
      vegetable oil. The herbaceous magic begins with a paste made from sliced
      garlic, fresh tarragon, and flat-leaf parsley, creating a burst of
      aromatic flavors. Chef John's special herb spread, consisting of
      mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, fresh lemon juice, and a hint of cayenne
      pepper, is generously spooned over the top and sides of each salmon
      fillet. The cooking process involves a two-step approach: first, a quick
      broil under high heat for approximately 5 minutes to achieve a beautifully
      browned exterior, followed by a gentle bake at 350 degrees F until the
      internal temperature reaches a perfect 130 degrees F. This results in
      salmon that flakes easily with a fork, showcasing a harmonious blend of
      textures and flavors. Chef John's Salmon is not only a culinary
      masterpiece but also a testament to the art of balancing simplicity with
      sophistication in seafood preparation.
